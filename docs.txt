Modelling incoming jobs:
    Job events are modelled as poisson processes: independance, stationarity (probability of event occuringin small time interval is proportional to the length of the interval), memorylessness (events of the next time interval do not depend on this one)

    in a poisson process, interarrival times follow the exponential distribution- it has memoryless property

job arrival times:
    𝜆 is rate of arrival/unit time, 1/𝜆 is mean interarrival time

    n is number of servers, λ^(n) is the rate of arrival per server so n x λ^(n) is arrival rate of jobs

    α and 𝛽 in your system model define how the job arrival rate for single server 𝜆^(𝑛) scales with the system size 𝑛.

    𝜆^(𝑛) = 1 -  (𝛽 x n^-α)


    we want to study under different traffic conditions:
    1)the mean-field regime which corresponds to 𝛼 = 0, 𝛽 ∈ (0, 1)
    2)the Halfin-Whitt regime which corresponds to 𝛼 = 1/2, 𝛽 > 0
    3)the sub-Halfin-Whitt (resp. super-Halfin-Whitt) regime corresponding to 𝛼 ∈ (0, 1/2), 𝛽 > 0 (resp. 𝛼 ∈ (1/2, 1), 𝛽 > 0)
    4)the super-non-degenerate slow- down (NDS) regime corresponding to 𝛼 ≥ 1.




speed up function:

    if a job is allocated to i servers,its execution time decreases by factor of s(i). speed up function: s= (s(i), i ∈ {0,1,...,d^(n)})

    linear speed-up case: s(i) = i for all i ∈ [1,d^(n)]
    sub-linear speed-up case: there exists i ∈ [1,d^(n)] such that s(i) < i

jobs execution time:
    execution time of job on a single server is an exponential random variable with a unit mean ,independant of other jobs' execution times and the arrival process

    CAN INVESTIGATE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT EXECUTION TIME DISTRIBUTIONS LATER

queue:
    upon job arrival if no server is found available, the job is blocked/queued = loss.

server allocation scheme:
    a job can run on i ∈ [1,d^n] servers, a server processes max 1 job at any given time

    upon job arrival if atleast 1 server is available an allocation scheme is used to determine the number of available servers allocated to the job
    allocated server will remain occupied as long as the job executes

qs for arpan:
- how to try the other greedy scheme
- how the sublinear speed up function is set & how to incorporate it into my model
- why graphs appear different to final results
